<p>Description: <li>In this study, we have analyzed data pertaining to major macroeconomic in the areas of education, labor productivity, quality of private sector development, infrastructure development, public policies and institutions. An exploratory data analysis of various indicators finds that countries belonging to different income groups have a marked difference when compared to other groups; however, there are some overlaps. A clustering approach (using hierarchical clustering) suggests an alternate group of clusters compared to a simplistic World Bank clustering approach.</li>
<li>This study focused on the key macroeconomic indicators that play an important role in predicting a county’s GNI per capita and its income group classification based on World Bank data. We looked into how countries in different income groups faired against other income group classified countries. We created machine learning models viz. Random forest, CART, KNN, Gradient Boost and Neural Network using 10 fold cross validation and understood that the parameters like employment, education, cost of business startup, research and development, international taxation, age dependency ratio, ratio of female to male work force and bank non-performing loans to total gross loans played an important role in all the models</li></p>
